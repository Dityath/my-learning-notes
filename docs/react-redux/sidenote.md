# Sidenote

Before started, I just want to say that I already understand another state manager like [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context) or [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/). But, there are a lot of things that need to be learned too just like Redux.

I will learn Redux by watching this video below from Dev Ed and also reading the official [documentation](https://react-redux.js.org/) from react redux.

And personally, I think that Redux is really that complicated than other state management. But, I think that I can learn it by myself. And of course, I need to learn it since I'm a React fans.
