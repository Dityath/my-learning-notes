# My Learning

Basically, I'm a software engineer who likes to learn new things. And, this website are a collection of my learning journey (and some of my favorite things). Idk dunno what supposed to say here.

Oh well also, umm. I'm not really good at English, sorry if there are a lot of bad grammars. I'll try my best to write this in English.
